### Introduction To Policy as Code 



Within the domain of Information Technology, a policy is essentially a collection of rules, guidelines, or directives that govern the utilization of IT resources and the execution of operations. This might encompass, for instance, a series of conditions that code must satisfy to clear a security check and proceed to deployment. Alternatively, it might involve an authorization policy delineating the permissible access range for a given asset or resource.

Traditional methods of policy enforcement often embed authorization rules directly within the application, bypassing the benefits offered by a decoupled policy-as-code approach. Consequently, such policies lack the capability to be version-controlled or consistently replicated. Moreover, these conventional systems are not designed to accommodate policy testing, thereby creating obstacles in aligning with automated testing protocols.
